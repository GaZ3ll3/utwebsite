Simplified spherical harmonics $SP_n$ comes from infinite slab model, under strong scattering, one only needs to focus on azimuth angle scattering, and for the other direction of angle, it will integrate out.

Another good property of $SP_n$ is the recursive property of Legendre polynomials, indicates some sparsity of the operator system.
