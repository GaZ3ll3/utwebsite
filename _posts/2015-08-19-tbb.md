The ``Intel Threading Building Blocks`` or ``tbb`` is a library used to parallelize program in ``C++``. It does not depends on compiler like ``cilkplus``, it is more like ``OpenMP`` but with higher level access, and easier to handle with lambda from ``C++11``.

- initialize task scheduler.
The scheduler is expensive to open up and shut down. Always put the initializer at the very beginning and try not to create any scheduler afterwards.

- three main loops
``parallel_for``, ``parallel_reduce``, ``parallel_scan`` are three main loops used.
