For many PDE problems, they have some integral equation representation form too. I once mentioned whether it is good or not to put problem into integral form or not. For a lot of times, I think explicit form of something like Green's function is necessary for such a solution
$$u = \int G(x, y)f(y)$$
over surface or volume.
